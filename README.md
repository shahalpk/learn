# Organization

Each folder in the root folder represents a book.

Each folder in the book folder (other than the folders starting with `_`) represents a chapter in the book. The format of the folder name is `[chapter index in 2 digits zero padded]-[chapter name in kebab case]`. For e.g. `31-linked-links`.

Each chapter folder consists of an `README.md` file in a standard format as in [STANDARD FOLDER DOCUMENT](./FOLDER.md)

Each chapter contains several programming challenges and each will be indexed and referred properly.
