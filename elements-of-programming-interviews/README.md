# Elements of Programming Interviews

This folder is for all programs i've done as part of reading `Elements of Programming Interviews` by Adnan Aziz, Amit Prakash.

This book is based on C++, but i'll be using Java for finding the solution.

## Organization

Each folder (other than the folders starting with `_`) represents a chapter in the book. The format of the folder name is `[chapter index in 2 digits zero padded]-[chapter name in kebab case]`. For e.g. `31-linked-links`.

Each chapter folder consists of an `README.md` file in a standard format as below.

```


```

Each chapter contains several programming challenges and each will be indexed and referred properly.
